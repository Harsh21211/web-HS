            <h2>Our Comprehensive Training Program</h2>
            <p>Our training program is designed to provide a thorough, hands-on experience in the world of web development. Trainees begin with a structured learning path that covers foundational topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend development with Node.js. As they progress, they engage in more complex and challenging projects, enabling them to develop the skills needed to work across the entire stack of web technologies.</p>
            <p>In addition to technical skills, we focus on important professional attributes such as problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. We foster a collaborative work environment where trainees are mentored by senior developers and encouraged to ask questions, share ideas, and experiment with new technologies. Our goal is to equip them with the knowledge and experience needed to thrive in the ever-evolving field of web development.</p>

            <h2>Mentorship and Career Growth</h2>
            <p>At Hot Beans Web, mentorship is at the heart of our training program. Every trainee is paired with a mentor—a senior developer with extensive industry experience—who provides guidance, feedback, and support throughout their learning journey. This one-on-one relationship allows trainees to ask questions, get feedback on their work, and develop their skills under the careful guidance of someone who has walked the path they are on.</p>
            <p>Mentorship goes beyond just technical training; our mentors also help trainees build their careers by providing insight into the web development industry, offering advice on best practices, and guiding them through the challenges of real-world projects. We believe that fostering a growth mindset and providing strong support systems is key to the success of our trainees.</p>

            <h2>Real-World Projects and Hands-On Experience</h2>
            <p>Our trainees don't just learn theory—they apply their skills in real-world settings. They are given the opportunity to work on live projects for actual clients, building websites, applications, and digital solutions that help businesses grow. This exposure to live projects allows trainees to gain experience in areas like project management, client communication, and version control, which are essential in a real-world work environment.</p>
            <p>Throughout their training, trainees work with teams, using the same tools and workflows as our experienced developers. This hands-on experience ensures that they are fully prepared to enter the workforce upon completing their training, equipped with practical skills and knowledge that will set them apart in the job market.</p>
